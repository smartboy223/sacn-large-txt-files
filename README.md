# 🔍 Scan Large TXT Files

**Stop opening 4GB files in Notepad.** Search across dozens of huge `.txt` files in seconds — with AND, OR, NOT, wildcards, and regex. All on your machine, zero cloud.

---

## 🎯 Why use this instead of the old way?

| ❌ Old way | ✅ This tool |
|------------|--------------|
| Open one file at a time, Ctrl+F, repeat for 20 files | **Search 20+ files at once** — one query, one click |
| Notepad/Excel crashes on multi-GB files | **Streaming** — files never fully loaded, no crash |
| No way to say “password AND email but NOT test” | **Full query syntax**: AND, OR, NOT, LIKE, wildcards, regex |
| Copy-paste from one file, then the next… | **Copy/Save** selected or all results in one go |
| No idea which file had the hit | **See file + line** for every result, sort & dedupe |
| Your data sent to “search engines” or unknown tools | **100% local** — nothing leaves your PC |

So: **faster**, **smarter**, and **private**. One app, any folder, any size.

---

## 🚀 What makes it powerful?

- **⚡ Built for huge files** — Handles 20+ files of several GB each. Streams in 8MB chunks so RAM stays low.
- **🔄 Parallel scan** — Up to 4 files at a time (configurable). Wall-clock time drops by ~4×.
- **🎯 Smart pre-filter** — For queries like `alice AND password`, lines without both terms are skipped before any heavy work. Most lines never touch the full matcher.
- **📋 Query language** — Not just “find word”. Combine keywords with AND, OR, NOT, LIKE, and regex. Exclude junk in one field.
- **🖥️ One UI for everything** — Pick folder, choose files, run query, see progress, copy or save results. No scripts, no CLI to remember.
- **🔒 Your data stays yours** — Runs on localhost. No accounts, no uploads, no telemetry.

---

## 👀 Who is it for?

- **Researchers & analysts** — Comb through big log dumps or export files without opening each one.
- **Devs & admins** — Grep-style search across many configs or logs with a real query language.
- **Anyone with large text datasets** — Credential lists, scrape results, CSV-like exports — if it’s lines of text, this tool can search it.

## ✨ Features

### 🔤 Advanced query syntax

| Syntax | Meaning | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `keyword` | Lines containing the keyword | `password` |
| `a, b, c` | Lines containing **any** (OR) | `gmail, hotmail, yahoo` |
| `a AND b` | Lines containing **both** | `password AND email` |
| `a OR b` | Either | `alice OR bob` |
| `NOT x` | Lines **not** containing x | `NOT test` |
| `a AND NOT b` | a but not b | `password AND NOT test` |
| `a LIKE b` | Lines with both a and b | `alice LIKE @gmail.com` |
| `key*word` | Wildcard | `pass*` |
| Regex | Full regex (toggle on) | `\d{3}-\d{4}` |

**Pro tip:** Type `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, or `LIKE` and press **Tab** to autocomplete.

---

### 📁 File browser & navigation

- **Back / Forward / Up** — Navigate folders like in Explorer.
- **Browse** — Windows folder picker (stays on top of the browser).
- **Files** — Choose exactly which `.txt` files to include in the search.
- **Badge** — Shows file count and total/selected size.

---

### ⚡ Under the hood (why it’s fast)

| Optimization | What it does |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Parallel files** | 4 files scanned at once (1–8 configurable). |
| **Mandatory-keyword pre-filter** | For AND/keyword queries, drop lines missing a term with a single `indexOf` — no extra allocations. |
| **Exclude first** | Excluded keywords checked before the full matcher. |
| **Streaming reads** | 8MB chunks, so multi-GB files don’t fill memory. |
| **Throttled progress** | Progress every ~8MB so the UI stays responsive. |

---

### 🎛️ Search options

| Toggle | What it does |
|--------|----------------|
| **Regex** | Query is a full regular expression. |
| **Case** | Case-sensitive matching. |
| **Word** | Whole-word boundaries only. |
| **Fast** | Parallel scan enabled. |
| **LIVE** | Results stream in as they’re found. |

---

### 📊 Display options

Choose what you see (and what you copy/save):

| Column | Shows |
|--------|--------|
| **#** | Row number in the results list |
| **Line** | Line number in the source file |
| **File** | Source filename |
| **Content Only** | Just the line text (default) |

**Copy & Quick Save** use the same format as the display — content-only or full (file, line, content).

---

### 💾 Buttons & tools

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Search** | Run the query |
| **Stop** | Cancel the search |
| **Quick Save** | Download as `search_results.txt` (browser asks where to save) |
| **Copy Sel** | Copy selected rows (or current page) — format matches display |
| **Copy All** | Copy all results — format matches display |
| **Clear** | Clear the results list |

| Tool | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Sort A→Z / Z→A** | Sort by file then line (toggle each click). |
| **Replace** | Find-and-replace in result content. |
| **Deduplicate** | Remove duplicates and see how many were removed. |

---

### 📦 Big result sets

- **Pagination** — 200 results per page so the UI stays smooth even with 500k+ hits.
- **Dedupe** — Shows “Removed N duplicates (M remaining)”.
- **Sort** — One click to flip between A→Z and Z→A.

---

## 🏃 Quick start

### What you need

- **Windows 10/11** (for the native folder picker; search logic works on any OS).
- **Node.js 18+** — [download](https://nodejs.org).

### Run (Windows)

Double-click **`start.bat`**. It will:

1. Install dependencies (first run only).
2. Start the API on port **3000**.

```
📁 project/
└── start.bat    ← double-click
```

### Run (any OS)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev:all
```

Then open **http://localhost:5174**.

  "exclude": "test, spam",
  "maxResults": 100000,

  "filePaths": [],
  "concurrency": 4,
  "options": { "caseSensitive": false, "wholeWord": false, "regex": false }
}
```

## 📈 Performance in practice

- **20 large files:** Parallel scan ≈ **4× faster** than doing them one by one.
- **AND / keyword queries:** Pre-filter skips **most lines** before the full matcher — big win on huge files.
- **Worst case:** OR-only or complex regex = full scan; still streaming and parallel, so it doesn’t crash.

---

## 🧪 Run API tests

With the server running:

```bash
node server/test-api.cjs
```

Runs health check and save endpoint tests.
